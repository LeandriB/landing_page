# Landing Page

## About

The goal for this project was to turn a static version of Landing Page into an interactive version. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file. This included building a navigation bar, adding a scroll function to each section on the page and showing which element is currently active. 

The starter code was provided by Udacity via this [repo](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page)

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
